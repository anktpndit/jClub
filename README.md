# jClub

jClub is a website, where students can register and login, and can 'follow' or 'register' a club. Each student have their own personal profile, and each clubs have their own personal pages as well. The sudents can go to their profile and see which clubs they are registered to and what activites are going on, on those registered clubs. The clubs have their own personal pages as well, from where they can add different activities that they are going to do. Students then can see those activities regardless of whether they are registered or not, since we have also implemented a search engine to search for the many clubs that are present in the database. You can search by the names of the clubs, by the year it was founded on, by the activities it has, and so on. The search engine also provides auto complete feature by actively looking up our database server.

There is also a page for the admin, where he/she can register a particular student to a particular club, and can also handle the pages of all the clubs. Admin can do anything that is possible on the website since he/she has the highest privelege. We also have a map inside our website, that shows your current location with the help of APIs available on the internet.

We used phpMyAdmin for hosting a database server locally on our computer. Then we used PHP language to connect to our localhost database server, and basically used it as a communicating bridge between our website and our database server. For the website's front-end we used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4, and some Javascript. For backend we used PHP, MYSQL, AJax, and some Javascript.

Languages Used: PHP, HTML, CSS, Ajax, MySQL Database, Bootstrap 4

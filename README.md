jClub is a website, where students make their account, and can 'follow' or 'register to' a club. Each student has their own personal profile, and each club has their own personal pages as well. The students can go to their individual profiles and see which clubs they are registered to and what activities are happening on those registered clubs. The clubs, from their profile, can add different activities that they are going to do. Students then can see those activities regardless of whether they are registered or not, since we have also implemented a search engine to search for the clubs that are present in the database. You can search by the name of the clubs, by the year it was founded on, by the activities it has, and so on. The search engine also provides auto complete feature by looking up the database server.

There is also a page for the admin, where he/she can register a particular student to a particular club, and can also handle the pages of all the clubs. Admin can do anything that is possible on the website since he/she has the highest privilege. We also have a map inside our website which shows your current geographical location. This was done with the help of APIs.

We used PhpMyAdmin for hosting a database server locally on our computer. Then we used PHP language to connect to our localhost database server, and basically used it as a communicating bridge between our website and our database server. For the website's front-end we used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4, and some JavaScript. For backend, we used PHP, MySQL, Ajax, and some JavaScript.

We also made a python script to plot the statistics of our website.

Security was also taken into consideration when building this project. Attacks like SQL injection were handled to the best of our ability.

Languages Used: PHP, HTML, CSS, Ajax, MySQL Database, Bootstrap 4
